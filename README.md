# HipHopToday

HipHopToday is a website hosted on GitHub Pages at http://naveedgol.com/HipHopToday

Uses a python web crawler to pull data from http://www.billboard.com/charts/r-b-hip-hop-songs for the past decade

New data is published using cron to run a refresh script at midnight (if my computer is on lol)
